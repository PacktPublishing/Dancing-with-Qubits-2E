## About the book

Dancing with Qubits, Second Edition, is a comprehensive quantum computing textbook that starts with an overview of why quantum computing is so different from classical computing and describes several industry use cases where it can have a major impact. A full description of classical computing and the mathematical underpinnings of quantum computing follows, helping you better understand concepts such as superposition, entanglement, and interference. Next up are circuits and algorithms, both basic and sophisticated, as well as a survey of the physics and engineering ideas behind how quantum computing hardware is built. Finally, the book looks to the future and gives you guidance on understanding how further developments may affect you.

This new edition is updated throughout with more than 100 new exercises and includes new chapters on NISQ algorithms and quantum machine learning.

Understanding quantum computing requires a lot of math, and this book doesn't shy away from the necessary math concepts you'll need. Each topic is explained thoroughly and with helpful examples, leaving you with a solid foundation of knowledge in quantum computing that will help you pursue and leverage quantum-led technologies.

## Get to know the Authors
_Robert S. Sutor_ has been a technical leader and executive in the IT industry for over 40 years. More than two decades of that were spent in IBM Research in Yorktown Heights, New York USA. During his time there, he worked on and led efforts in symbolic mathematical computation, mathematical programming languages, optimization, AI, blockchain, and quantum computing. He is the author of Dancing with Qubits: How quantum computing works and how it can change the world and Dancing with Python: Learn Python software development from scratch and get started with quantum computing, also with Packt. He is the published co-author of several research papers and the book Axiom: The Scientific Computation System with the late Richard D. Jenks.

Sutor was an IBM executive on the software side of the business in areas including Java web application servers, emerging industry standards, software on Linux, mobile, and open source. He was the Vice President of Corporate Development and, later, Chief Quantum Advocate, at Infleqtion, a quantum computing and quantum sensing company based in Boulder, Colorado USA. He is currently an Adjunct Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University at Buffalo, New York, USA.

He is a theoretical mathematician by training, has a Ph.D. from Princeton University, and an undergraduate degree from Harvard College. He started coding when he was 15 and has used most of the programming languages that have come along.
